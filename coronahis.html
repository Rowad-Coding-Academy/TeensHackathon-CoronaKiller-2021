        <h3 class="role">Coronaviruses are a big family of different viruses. 
            Some of them cause the common cold in people. Others infect animals, 
            including bats, camels, and cattle. But how did SARS-CoV-2, 
            the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19, come into being?

            Here’s what we know about the virus that was first detected in Wuhan, China, in late 2019 
            and has set off a global pandemic.
            
            Where Did the Coronavirus Come From?
            Experts say SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats. 
            That’s also how the coronaviruses behind Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) 
            and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) got started.
            
            SARS-CoV-2 made the jump to humans at one of Wuhan’s open-air “wet markets.”
             They’re where customers buy fresh meat and fish, including animals that are killed on the spot.
            
            Some wet markets sell wild or banned species like cobras,<br> wild boars, and raccoon dogs.
             Crowded conditions can let viruses from <br>different animals <br>swap genes.
              <br>Sometimes the virus changes so much it can start to infect and spread <br>among people.</h3>
