        <h2 class="name">Economic corona risks</h2>

        <h3 class="role">New outbreaks of Covid-19 remain one of the top risks to a global economic recovery,
             the OECD’s<br> secretary-general has warned, 
             calling for developed nations to support less-developed nations<br> with their vaccination programs.

            “We must do what we can to get as many people as we can, <br>all around the world, 
            vaccinated. 
            There <br>is a particular responsibility for developed economies 
            and it’s not just a matter of charity or <br>benevolence,
             it’s actually a matter of self interest both in terms of making sure we keep our <br>populations safe
              ... and also to ensure the economic recovery can be sustained,” Mathias Cormann, <br>
              secretary-general of the OECD, said Thursday.
            
            “New outbreaks are still one of the biggest downside <br>risks in terms of the sustained economic 
            recovery moving forward,” he told CNBC’s Annette Weisbach.
            
            <br>“There is a race on between getting as many people vaccinated all 
            around the world including and <br>in particular in developing economies 
            and the risk of new variants appearing, and variants that may <br>be resistant 
            to the vaccines currently available,” he noted.</h3>
