        <h2 class="name">Corona Virus</h2>
        <h3 class="role">Coronaviruses are a group of related RNA viruses that 
            cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans and
            birds, they cause respiratory tract infections that
            can range from mild to lethal. Mild illnesses in 
            humans include some cases of the common cold 
            (which is also caused by other viruses, predominantly
            rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause
            SARS, MERS, and COVID-19.
            In cows and pigs they cause
            diarrhea, while in mice they cause hepatitis and 
            encephalomyelitis.<br>Coronaviruses constitute the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae,
            in the family Coronaviridae,<br> order Nidovirales, and realm
            Riboviria.<br>They are enveloped viruses with a
            positive-sense <br>single-stranded RNA genome and a nucleocapsid
            of helical symmetry.<br>The genome size of coronaviruses 
            ranges from approximately 26 to 32 kilobases,<br> one of the 
            largest among RNA viruses.<br>They have characteristic 
            club-shaped spikes that project from their surface,<br> which 
            in electron micrographs create an image reminiscent of the<br>
            solar corona,from which their name derives.</h3>
